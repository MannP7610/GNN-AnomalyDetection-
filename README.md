# GNN-AnomalyDetection-
This project uses an unsupervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) to detect anomalies in a manufacturing process. Tabular data is converted into a graph-based representation, capturing machine-worker interactions. The model identifies irregular patterns, ensuring accurate anomaly detection while minimizing false positives.
